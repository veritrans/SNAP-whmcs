#### Log options
Logging is not something that is always enabled. This is to avoid logs growing too large, so itâ€™s something that needs enabling for the logging to occur.
Enabling logging can help you trace what happened and help troubleshoot technical issues.

1. Make sure your Administrator role has the View Module Debug Log permission.
2. Go to `Configuration > System Logs > Module Log (Utilities > Logs > Module Log in WHMCS 7.x and earlier)`.
3. Switch Module Logging to On.

You can view the Module logs at `Configuration > System Logs > Module Log (Utilities > Logs > Module Log in WHMCS 7.x and earlier)`

#### Troubleshooting

If you encounter payment popup not being properly opened on invoice page, try these solution:

On menu `Setup -> Payments -> Payment Gateways`, tick option `Payment Redirect To Midtrans`. Customer will be redirected to Midtrans instead of popup. This can minimize popup issue.

If you use non IDR currency on WHMCS and encounter issue of paid amount is too big or does not match with invoice amount: 

Try to enable configuration `Use Invoice amount as paid amount` to use the invoice amount as paid amount. Note: this will also means it will not check the actual paid amount on Payment Gateway, but it can avoid currency conversion issues.

Or Try to enable `Try convert back paid amount currency` to try to convert back from paid amount in IDR to original customer currency, using builtin WHMCS converter. Note: WHMCS converter may not 100% accurate.
